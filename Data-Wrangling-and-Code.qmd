In order to address iFood's concern that a large portion of the customers haven't made a purchase in over 60 days (customer churn) we need to do some wrangling and play around with some visualizations.

## Data Wrangling

```{r setup, eval = FALSE}

# Load packages.

library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}

# Read in data, and look at the first few lines.

ifood <- read_csv('ifood.csv', show_col_types = F)

ifood

```

```{r}

# Clean up the marital status column

ifood <- ifood |> 
  filter(Marital_Status != "YOLO", 
         Marital_Status != "Alone", 
         Marital_Status != "Absurd")

```

```{r}

summary(ifood$Income)
```

```{r}

# Turn education into an ordered factor.

ifood <- ifood |>
  mutate(
    Education = factor(Education, levels = c("High School", "Bachelor's", "Master's", "PhD"))
  )
```

```{r}

# Create age groups using the birth years.

ifood <- ifood |>
  mutate(
    Age = 2025 - Year_Birth,
    age_group = case_when(
      Age >= 18 & Age < 30 ~ "18-29",
      Age >= 30 & Age < 45 ~ "30-44",
      Age >= 45 & Age < 60 ~ "45-59",
      Age >= 60 & Age < 75 ~ "60-74",
      Age >= 75 ~ "75+"
    ),
    age_group = factor(age_group, levels = c("18-29", "30-44", "45-59", "60-74", "75+"))
  )
```

```{r}

# Create Income brackets.

ifood <- ifood |>
  mutate(
    income_bracket = case_when(
      Income >= 0 & Income < 25000 ~ "0-25K",
      Income >= 25000 & Income < 50000 ~ "25-50K",
      Income >= 50000 & Income < 100000 ~ "50-100K",
      Income >= 100000 & Income < 200000 ~ "100-200K",
      Income >= 200000 ~ "200K+"
    ),
    income_bracket = factor(income_bracket, levels = c("0-25K", "25-50K", "50-100K", "100-200K", "200K+"))
  )

```

## Exploratory Data Analysis

```{r}

# We are interested in the distribution of recency. How many customers haven't purchased anything in over 60 days?

ifood |> count(Recency > 60)
```

```{r}

# For my analysis, I will consider these customers to have "churned."

ifood <- ifood |> 
  mutate(Churned = if_else(Recency > 60, "Yes", "No"))
```

```{r}

# I want to figure out what demographic groups are more likely to churn, so I will compare churn rate across different catgeorical variables.

# Marital Status

ifood |> 
  filter(!is.na(Marital_Status)) |> 
  count(Marital_Status, Churned) |> 
  group_by(Marital_Status) |> 
  mutate(prop = n / sum(n)) |> 
  ggplot(aes(
    x = Marital_Status, 
    y = n, 
    fill = Churned
  )) +
  geom_col(position = "fill") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("No" = "cornflowerblue", "Yes" = "darkblue")) +
  labs(x = "Marital Status", y = "Churn Rate (%)", title = "Churn Rate by Marital Status", subtitle = 'Based on a sample of 2,240 iFood customers')+ 
  theme_minimal()
```

```{r}

# Education

ifood |> 
  filter(!is.na(Education)) |> 
  count(Education, Churned) |> 
  group_by(Education) |> 
  mutate(prop = n / sum(n)) |> 
  ggplot(aes(
    x = Education, 
    y = n, 
    fill = Churned
  )) +
  geom_col(position = "fill") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("No" = "cornflowerblue", "Yes" = "darkblue")) +
  labs(x = "Education Level", y = "Churn Rate (%)", title = "Churn Rate by Education Level", subtitle = 'Based on a sample of 2,240 iFood customers')+ 
  theme_minimal()
```

```{r}

# Age Group

ifood |> 
  filter(!is.na(age_group)) |> 
  count(age_group, Churned) |> 
  group_by(age_group) |> 
  mutate(prop = n / sum(n)) |> 
  ggplot(aes(
    x = age_group, 
    y = n, 
    fill = Churned
  )) +
  geom_col(position = "fill") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("No" = "cornflowerblue", "Yes" = "darkblue")) +
  labs(x = "Age Group", y = "Churn Rate (%)", title = "Churn Rate by Age Group", subtitle = 'Based on a sample of 2,240 iFood customers')+ 
  theme_minimal()
```

```{r}

# Income Bracket

ifood |> 
  filter(!is.na(income_bracket)) |> 
  count(income_bracket, Churned) |> 
  group_by(income_bracket) |> 
  mutate(prop = n / sum(n)) |> 
  ggplot(aes(
    x = income_bracket, 
    y = n, 
    fill = Churned
  )) +
  geom_col(position = "fill") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("No" = "cornflowerblue", "Yes" = "darkblue")) +
  labs(x = "Income Bracket", y = "Churn Rate (%)", title = "Churn Rate by Income Bracket", subtitle = 'Based on a sample of 2,240 iFood customers')+ 
  theme_minimal()
```
